Hi, I'm Narun Raman! Pronounced like Maroon Ramen (quite an unappetizing sight) with an N (people have interpreted this slightly incorrectly and called me Manun so maybe I should find a new explanation). Feel free to send me pictures of oddly colored noodles.

I am currently a senior (fourth-year) undergraduate student pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Public Policy at Carleton College (not the University) in the land of Cows, Colleges, and Contentment: Northfield, Minnesota.

I am very available via email, my basic interests are detailed below and I am interested in working in those areas. Please reach out if you need a plucky undergraduate for your research.
