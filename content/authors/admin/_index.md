Hi, I'm Narun Raman! Pronounced like Maroon Ramen (quite an unappetizing sight) with an N. People have sometimes interpreted this slightly incorrectly and called me Manun so maybe I should find a new explanation. However, Feel free to send me pictures of oddly colored noodles.

I will be starting a Master's program in Computer Science at the University of British Columbia in 2021 fall. I am very available via email, my basic interests are detailed below and I am interested in working in those areas. Please reach out if you want to work with me -- my physical body is in Minneapolis but I can be reached at [narun dot raman at gmail dot com].
